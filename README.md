# Web--scraping-project
Web scraping from the movie website "Metacritic"

Project Goal:
Fetching movie information for the top 500 most popular movies from Metacritics. On this website, there is an option to show the top movies. 
On Metacritics, it is called “Movies of All Time”.
The users are given three choices:
1. The 1st choice is ‘movie’. When the user chooses this one, the program asks for the name of a movie. Then our program finds the movie and displays the cast information and genre information.
2. The 2nd choice is ‘people’. When the user chooses this one, the program asks for the name of an actor/actress and then finds the person, and displays: (a) all the movies that this person has acted in, (b) a summary of the genres of the these movies.
3. The 3rd choice is ‘comparison'. When the user choose this one, the program asks for the names of 2 actors/actresses, and calculates their cosine similarity based on the genre of movies they have acted in.
